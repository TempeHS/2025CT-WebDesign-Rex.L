    <h1>Xbox Game Console

        <h2>How it started</h2>
        <br>
        <para>Four engineers from Microsoft's DirectX team—Kevin Bachus, Seamus Blackley, Ted Hase and DirectX team
            leader Otto
            Berkes, began to envision what a Microsoft console to compete against the PlayStation 2 would be like. They
            designed a
            system that would use many hardware components in common with PCs, effectively running a version of Windows
            and DirectX
            to power the games on the console. While the original Xbox had modest sales, Microsoft took a large
            financial loss to support it. However, its performance
            was sufficient to convince the company to continue to produce the line. Since its release, there have been
            four
            generations of Xbox, with the most recent being the Xbox Series X and Series S units. The Xbox has become a
            direct
            competitor to Sony's PlayStation brand, both offering high performance gaming systems at roughly similar
            specifications. Four engineers from Microsoft's DirectX team—Kevin Bachus, Seamus Blackley, Ted Hase and
            DirectX team leader Otto
            Berkes, began to envision what a Microsoft console to compete against the PlayStation 2 would be like. They
            designed a
            system that would use many hardware components in common with PCs, effectively running a version of Windows
            and DirectX
            to power the games on the console.This approach would make it easy for developers on Windows to build games
            for
            their new system, differentiating itself from the custom hardware solutions of most consoles.Numerous names
            were
            suggested for this console, including "Direct X Box", and the "Windows Entertainment Project".Microsoft's
            marketing team conducted consumer surveys of the name, using the name "Xbox" as a control believing this
            would be least
            desirable, but found that this had the highest preference from their tests, and was selected as the name of
            the
            console.</para>

        <h2><strong>The Xbox 360</strong></h2>
        <br>
        <para>The Xbox 360 was released as the successor of the original Xbox in November 2005, competing with Sony's
            PlayStation 3
            and Nintendo's Wii as part of the seventh generation of video game consoles. It featured a custom
            triple-core 64-bit
            PowerPC-based processor design by IBM with 512 MB of RAM memory. As of June 2014, 84 million Xbox 360
            consoles have been
            sold worldwide.The Xbox 360 was officially unveiled on MTV on May 12, 2005, with detailed launch and game
            information divulged later that month at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3). The console sold out
            completely upon
            release in all regions except in Japan.Several retail configurations of the core Xbox 360 model were
            offered over its lifetime, varying the amount of RAM and internal storage offered.</para>
        <br>
        <para>Two major revisions of the Xbox 360 were released following the initial launch. The Xbox 360 S (typically
            considered as
            "Slim"), launched in 2010, featured the same core hardware but with a redesigned, slimmer form factor with a
            smaller-sized 250 GB hard drive. It also added integrated 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi, TOSLINK S/PDIF optical audio
            output, five
            USB 2.0 ports (compared to the three from older versions) and a special port designed for the Kinect
            peripheral. The
            Xbox 360 S replaced the base Xbox 360 unit, which was discontinued, and sold at the same price.A cheaper
            Xbox 360 S unit, removing the 250 GB drive while adding 4 GB of internal storage, was released later in
            2010; the unit
            allowed users to hook up an external storage solution or purchase a 250 GB internal add-on.</para>

        <h2>Xbox One</h2>
        <br>
        <para>e Xbox One was released on November 22, 2013, in North America, as the successor to the Xbox 360. The Xbox
            One competes
            with Sony's PlayStation 4 and Nintendo's Wii U and Switch as part of the eighth generation of video game
            consoles. It
            features an AMD Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) built around the 64-bit x86-64 instruction set and can
            come with up to
            12 GB of memory.

            Announced on May 21, 2013,the Xbox One has an emphasis on internet-based features, including the ability to
            record
            and stream gameplay, and the ability to integrate with a set-top box to watch cable or satellite TV through
            the console
            with an enhanced guide interface and Kinect-based voice control.

            Following its unveiling, the Xbox One proved controversial for its original digital rights management and
            privacy
            practices; while Microsoft touted the ability for users to access their library of games (regardless of
            whether they
            were purchased physically or digitally) on any Xbox One console without needing their discs, and the ability
            to share
            their entire library with 10 designated "family" members, all games would have to be tied to the user's Xbox
            Live
            account and their Xbox One console, and the console would be required to connect to the Internet on a
            periodic basis (at
            least once every 24 hours) to synchronize the library, or else the console would be unable to play any games
            at
            all.After an overwhelmingly negative response from critics and consumers (who also showed concerns that the
            system could prevent or hinder the resale of used games), Microsoft announced that these restrictions would
            be
            dropped.Microsoft was also criticized for requiring the Xbox One to have its updated Kinect peripheral
            plugged in
            to function, which critics and privacy advocates believed could be used as a surveillance device. As a
            gesture toward
            showing a commitment to user privacy, Microsoft decided to allow the console to function without Kinect.

            On June 13, 2016, Microsoft announced the Xbox One S at E3 2016, which featured a smaller form factor, as
            well as
            support for 4K video (including streaming and Ultra HD Blu-ray) and HDR.At E3 2017, Microsoft unveiled Xbox
            One X,
            a high-end model with improved hardware designed to facilitate the playing of games at 4K resolution.</para>
